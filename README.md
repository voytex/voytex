# Hey! I'm voyTeX
My name is Vojtěch Lukáš and I like coffee. Currently I am also a student of Communications and Informatics at Brno University of Technology, senior audio engineer at Janacek Academy of Performing Arts, musician playing in a folk band, amateur tinkerer and a passionate roadbiker. 

I feel comfortable using:
- C/C++ (embedded)
- Python
- TCP/IP
- a bit of signal processing
- LaTeX (passionately, hehe)
